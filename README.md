# Christmasify Chrome Extension
A bit of fun for the [Codebar] Brighton chapter Christmas show and tell on December 17th 2019.
Add some Christmas tat to any website. Includes animated snowfall and boughs of holly.

I've provided plenty of comments in the source code if you're interested in having a rummage.

Enjoy!
